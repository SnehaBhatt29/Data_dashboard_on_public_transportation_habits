# Data_dashboard_on_public_transportation_habits
I conducted data visualization on real-time collected data, marking my first foray into this field. My aim is to continue enhancing my analytical skills in Excel. In this project, we identified a problem related to daily transportation, developed a potential solution, and forecasted its implementation in a business scenario. Utilizing pivot table charts allowed for clearer and more effective visualization of the data.
